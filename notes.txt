To add and commit we can use.
$ git commit -am “<message>”

Un-stage and Rename File
eg.: git mv filetodelete.txt keepfile.txt.
• The way we stage a file to track, the same way we can upstage the file to untrack.
eg.: git reset HEAD filename.txt

Branch or Tag ?
• Branch is something like a separate thread
• Whereas Tag is like a Label.
• Assume you have stable release with some bug fixes say v1.0 :-
• This version fixes bug123
• This version fixes bug456
• This is final v1.0
This represents state of code.
Use Tags to mark release points

Tagging
• List all tags:-
• Creating tag with inline message:-
• Creating tag for longer message:-
➢ git tag
➢ git tag –l “v1.3.1*” → tags with particular pattern
➢ git tag v1.0 –m "Tagging version 1.0"
➢ git tag –a v1.0 → opens default editor for longer message

Stashing
• While resolving a bug on some branch, say we have got some high priority task
• We can't commit coz its half done, we can't discard otherwise, rework.
• Then how should we 
handle this messy state 
of work?
• We have Stash
to store temporarily

Stashing
• Stashing is dirty state of working directory.
• i.e. modified tracked files and staged changes – and saves it on stack of unfinished changes that we can reapply at anytime.
➢ git stash → saves working dir to stash
➢ git stash list → show all stash
➢ git stash apply →reapply recent stash
